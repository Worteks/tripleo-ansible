    Previously the tripleo-ssh-known-hosts ansible role used the list of
    network names to create the different possible hostnames in the
    ssh_known_hosts file. The network names do not match the actual network
    hostnames, like internal_api vs. internalapi which results in ssh host
    verification to fail and e.g. live migration to fail.
    This changes to use the _hostname inventory information to be used to add
    hostname information to the ssh_known_hosts file.
